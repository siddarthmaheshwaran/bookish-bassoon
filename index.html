        <p class="text-muted text-left ">Taco Bell is an American-based chain of fast food restaurants originating in Irvine, California in 1962, by founder Glen Bell. Taco Bell is a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, Inc. The restaurants serve a variety of Mexican-inspired foods, including tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, novelty and speciality items, and a variety of "value menu" items. As of 2018, Taco Bell serves over two billion customers each year, at 7,072 restaurants, more than 93 percent of which are owned and operated by independent franchisees and licensees.

PepsiCo purchased Taco Bell in 1978, and later spun off its restaurants division as Tricon Global Restaurants, which later changed its name to Yum! Brands.</p>

"The Lion King" has been one of my favorite Disney animated films, so I was nervous about seeing Jon Favreau's remake. Surprisingly, from beginning to end, I found myself frequently enjoying this remake more than the original, and I had no problem with it. This remake absorbed my attention with it's remarkable visuals, and this is the only Disney lifelike remake that has no humans, and animals are my passion. Jon Favreau and his crew pulled it off so well, and how on earth did they do it? Let me explain: When it comes to the craftsmanship, it is an incredible technical achievement; in beats, we all knew it has the same story, but as you were watching it, you are wondering how it will be made differently, and I did not expect much at all. Jon Favreau displays his best direction here due to his effective and persistent timing and cadence. Not to mention that he has showcased the movie's heart that is in the perfect place, because of how well he handles the tone. The screenplay by Jeff Nathanson grabs my attention with the dynamic movements of the camera, and speaking of "camera," the gorgeous cinematography by Caleb Deschanel is always gripping with well-executed angles that are nicely illustrated. "The Lion King" is not only a visually dazzling marvel, but also an engrossing smartly-crafted spectacle, because of how vivid, elaborate, and how arresting it is. The filmmakers embraced the compelling themes that made the original so special, and they expanded the story with more detail and depth to the themes and even to the characters. The conservative themes here feel more reactionary than the original; it is injected with military implications and some political dialogue. The effects team brought this movie to life with virtual reality tools teamed with "Unity" to create photorealistic backgrounds with tangible details, and they've made the animals incredibly realistic with animalistic precision. I was also highly entertained by the fact that the filmmakers accepted the authentic animal behaviors with body language and no facial expressions, because most animals including big cast don't emote through facial expressions. This film would be an introduction of CGI for kids but parents have to check in with them first. The filmmakers cut out the anteaters, and used aardvarks and other African animals that families have never seen before. The way Hans Zimmer remade the score is fantastic with more notes, different themes, and more instruments. The new song "Spirit" is a brilliant fit for the film. The entire star-studded cast is pitch-perfect for their characters with effective delivery. And I must add that with body gestures and voice-acting, the chemistry between these creature characters is palpable. JD McCrary (young) and Donald Glover (adult) are emotionally involving as Simba. Beyonce as Nala is incredibly fitting. Alfre Woodard has fierce authority for voicing Sarabi. John Oliver is so amusing as the energetic Zazu. Timon and Pumbaa here are a hilarious silly gay couple; Billy Eichner is snarky as Timon, and Seth Rogan uses his hysterical energy as Pumbaa. James Earl Jones returns as Mufasa; sounding wise, warm, and old yet capable of using authority. Chewitel Ejiofer is dramatically haunting as the sinister Scar. Scar is portrayed differently here as a brooding and manipulative dictator of entitlement, greed, and lust. And lets not forget that the hyenas are dangerously realistic. Highly Recommended for the entire family (suitable for ages eight and up).</p>

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>
